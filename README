			ARRAY
	A generic dynamic array library

SUMMARY
	This library uses C preprocessor macros
	to define a generic array implementation.
	
	To define an integer array, type

	typedef array_define(int) int_array_t;

	or something similar.

	To initialize, it is very encouraged that
	you zero out the whole struct with memset(3),
	like

	int_array_t array;
	memset(&array, 0, sizeof array);

	to make sure no bugs occur.

	Setting elements should be done with array_set
	because it will automatically expand the array
	and zero the expanded part out.

	Finally, the array can be allocated with free(3).

INSTALLING
	This project uses autoconf/automake/libtool, so running
	'./autogen.sh' (which is 'autoreconf -i'), './configure',
	'make', then 'make install' will install the library.
